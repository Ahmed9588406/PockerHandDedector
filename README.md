Hand card detector using YOLOv8 is a computer vision system that detects playing cards in an image or video stream using the YOLOv8 algorithm
It pre-processes input images, runs them through the neural network, and outputs bounding boxes around detected cards
This system has applications in gaming, security, and automation.
I used Playing Cards Image Dataset from the roboflow site
this the link of the Dataset https://universe.roboflow.com/augmented-startups/playing-cards-ow27d/dataset/3 YOLO v8 Version
I showed every thing in the code in comments 
the pt file which name is playcards.pt is the weights of the trained model
the jpg file is the rules of the game
